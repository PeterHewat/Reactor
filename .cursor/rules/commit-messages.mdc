# Commit Message Guidelines

When generating commit messages, follow these conventions:

## Format

Use conventional commit format: `type: description`

## Allowed Types

Types must be one of:

- `feat` - A new feature
- `fix` - A bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only changes
- `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - A code change that improves performance
- `test` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
- `ci` - Changes to CI configuration files and scripts

## Rules

1. Keep the subject line under 72 characters
2. Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
3. Do not end the subject line with a period
4. If you can accurately express the change in just the subject line, don't include anything in the message body
5. Only use the body when it provides _useful_ information that cannot be conveyed in the subject line

## Examples

Good:

- `feat: add user authentication flow`
- `fix: resolve race condition in data fetching`
- `refactor: extract button variants to separate file`

Bad:

- `Added new feature` (not imperative, no type)
- `feat: Add user authentication flow.` (period at end, capitalized)
- `feat: this commit adds a new user authentication flow to the application` (too long, not imperative)
