# Testing Strategy

Create comprehensive tests for this code covering:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows with Playwright
- **Edge Cases**: Error conditions, boundary values, and failure scenarios
- **User Interactions**: Form submissions, clicks, navigation, and state changes
- **API Interactions**: Mock Convex queries/mutations and test data handling
- **Authentication**: Test auth flows with Clerk integration
- **Responsive Design**: Test UI across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Performance**: Test loading states and performance characteristics

Follow testing best practices:

- Use descriptive test names
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test behavior, not implementation details
